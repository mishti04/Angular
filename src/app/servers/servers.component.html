<p><b>$event</b> is a reserved keyword to give us access to event data.
    In this case the event is input i.e. keystroke.
    Becuase this is event binding and not 2 way data binding,
    the initial value of the server mentoned in component file which is teset server
    does not appear in the text box when we load the page.
    implying its only taking data from browser on the keystroke event to server.
    Not other way around.
</p>


<!-- Commenting event binding to use 2 way data binding
    <input type="text" class="from-control" (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)"> -->

<input type="text" class="from-control" [(ngModel)]="serverName">

<!-- Below commented section is although lame but a good example of the extent of 2 way data binding
    not only when the epage loads we can see the initial value of server name, the event binding part 
    triggers the onUpdateServer method on keystroke, but there we tried to change the server name to 
    Abrupt server name changed, that not only prints it below the textbox because we are printing the srevre name
    it also updates the value inside the textbox. So technically whatever the user types is not visible anymore.
    2 way data binding is the one responsible to change the value of the textbox when we are changing it from our component
    <input type="text" class="from-control" [(ngModel)] = "serverName"  (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)"> -->
<p>{{serverName}}</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer">Add Server</button>

<app-server></app-server>

<p>disabled is a html property which needs a value true or false
    We are providing it value from a variable.
    we are changing its value using setTimeout method, the browser now has
    to get the updated value.
</p>
<p>
    <b>For that we are using property binding.</b> because this is only one way i.e we are only doing something based on
    the
    input we are getting from js, we cant consider this as 2 way data binding..
</p>
<p>
    If we only wanted to print the value of the property rather than using it to enable/disable something, we could have
    also used string interpolation. In that case it wouldnt have made a difference
</p>
<p>
    Below is the example to show just that
</p>

<p>{{allowNewServer}} </p>
<p [innerText]="allowNewServer"> </p>

<p><b>Below is example of event binding.</b></p>
<p> parenthesis around click is angulars way of doing what htmk does with onClick. So
    whenever you find parentehsis know its from event binding</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer" (click)="onCreateServer()">Add Server</button>
<p>{{serverCreationStatus}}</p>
