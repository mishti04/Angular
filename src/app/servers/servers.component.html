<!-- disabled is a html property which needs a value true or false
We are providing it value from a variable. If the variable had a 
static value this would be considered string interpolation but because 
we are changing its value using setTimeout method, the browser now has 
to get the updated value. For this we are using via 2 way data binding
Where the function is constantly looking out for any updates to the variable.
